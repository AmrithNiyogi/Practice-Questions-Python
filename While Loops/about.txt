This file contains program in python that are implemented using while loops only.

There are 10 questions in this list: 

1. Sum of Natural Numbers: Write a program that calculates the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers (where \( n \) is a user-provided input) using a while loop.

2. Factorial Calculation: Create a program that computes the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

3. Fibonacci Sequence: Generate the first \( n \) numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (where \( n \) is a user-provided input) using a while loop.

4. Guessing Game: Implement a simple guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program should provide feedback whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses correctly.

5. Reverse Digits: Write a program that takes an integer as input and reverses its digits using a while loop.

6. Sum of Digits: Create a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer using a while loop.

7. Collatz Conjecture: Implement the Collatz conjecture sequence. Starting with a positive integer \( n \), repeatedly apply the rule: \( n = n / 2 \) if \( n \) is even, and \( n = 3n + 1 \) if \( n \) is odd, until \( n \) becomes 1.

8. User Authentication: Simulate a simple user authentication process. Prompt the user to enter a password and keep asking until they enter the correct password (predefined in the code).

9. Prime Number Check: Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using a while loop.

10. Countdown Timer: Implement a countdown timer that starts from a user-defined number of seconds and counts down to zero, displaying each
